# "Nigel's Excursion" - 2D-Side-Scrolling-Game
This endless, 2D Side-Scrolling PC game was developed at the Beachhacks hackathon 2018. It was developed in Unity using C#.

You play as Nigel, a famous architect. As you were heading back home after a day of digging, you notice strange monsters, objects, and portals are scattered across your way back. Run as far as you can to make it back home!

## Getting started
The instructions listed below will get you a working copy of the game on your local machine for testing purposes.
### Prerequisites
To download this game, you will need to clone the repository on your local machine. This can be accomplished by either downloading and using GitHub Desktop, or by downloading Git and using Git Bash commands.
### Installing
There are two methods of cloning this repository on your local machine.
1. Using GitHub desktop.
2. Using Git Bash commands.
#### Method 1
The easiest way to get the game through GitHub Desktop is by cloning the repository using the web URL. Once you have GitHub Desktop, follow these instructions to download the game.
```
First, find the green "Clone or download" button in the 2D-Side-Scrolling-Game repository.
```
The link to the repository is: https://github.com/Tanner-Mindrum/2D-Side-Scrolling-Game
```
Copy and paste the link found.
```
The link to copy and paste is: https://github.com/Tanner-Mindrum/2D-Side-Scrolling-Game.git

Now open GitHub Desktop.
```
Hover over the "File" tab and select "Clone repository"
```
This will bring up the "Clone a repository" menu.
```
Select the "URL" tab and paste the link we've copied into the "Repository URL" section.

Select the local path of where you want the repository to be cloned to.
```
The repository will now be cloned on your local machine.

Locate where the repository was cloned to. Open the file and execute the "Nigel's Never-ending Excursion" .exe file to play the game.
#### Method 2
This method will go over cloning the repository to your local machine using Git Bash commands. In this example, I will be cloning the repository to the desktop; however, you can select whichever directory you'd like when cloning the repository to your local machine. Input these commands using the Git Bash program.
```
cd ~/Desktop/
```
This command will change your directory to your desired directory.
```
git clone https://github.com/Tanner-Mindrum/2D-Side-Scrolling-Game.git
```
This command clones the repository to your computer in a sub-directory in the directory you started working in.
```
cd 2D-Side-Scrolling-Game

ls
```
These commands will display the files that should be stored in your local machine. The result should look like this:
```
"Nigel's Never-ending Excursion.exe"*    README.md
"Nigel's Never-ending Excursion_Data"/
```

Locate where the repository was cloned to. Open the file and execute the "Nigel's Never-ending Excursion" .exe file to play the game.
## Playing the game
To play the game, all you need is the spacebar to jump. Once you run into an enemy, the game will stop and ask you to restart or exit.
You can hit the "Enter" key or click the reset button to play.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
The exit button is currently bugged and we are working on a fix. For now, use Alt + F4 to exit the game.

We are continually working to enhance and update the game to bring you the most fun experience possible.
